## How I Built This

1. **Data Exploration** was performed using Jupyter Notebook (`Bitcoin.ipynb`) and visualized with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
2. The **interactive dashboard** was built using Streamlit and Plotly, developed in Spyder.
3. The app was run and tested locally using the Anaconda PowerShell prompt with:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
The project was uploaded to GitHub, and then deployed to Streamlit Cloud using the hosted repository.
